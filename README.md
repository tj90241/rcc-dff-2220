Netgate RCC-DFF-2220
====================
The RCC-DFF 2220 is a small, open Intel Rangely platform.

This repository has lots of configuration bits/notes as to how you can
configure it as a very low-power, high-performance, open router.

I did not include any of my DNS (bind9) or DHCP (isc-dhcp-server)
configuration as I did not want to leak too much information about my
setup. You're on your own for those two services!

Additional Hardware
===================
I bought an Intel 7260 802.11ac Dual-Band WiFI mini-PCIe card. It has some
limitations (20MHz band only in AP mode, etc.) that might bother some people,
but it works fine for me.

I needed a half-to-full size mini-PCIe bracket to properly mount the card.

I also added a 128GB Samsung CM871a M.2 SSD for additional storage.

Netgate Customer Support
========================
I contacted Netgate customer support on one instance and got a prompt, very
technical and expert response from one of their backline engineers. I cannot
recommend them enough.

I did not receive an evaluation unit and this is my own, personal opinion.
